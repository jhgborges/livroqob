abstract="In this chapter we review the basic features and the principles underlying molecular mechanics force fields commonly used in molecular modeling of biological macromolecules. We start by summarizing the historical background and then describe classical pairwise additive potential energy functions. We introduce the problem of the calculation of nonbonded interactions, of particular importance for charged macromolecules. Different parameterization philosophies are then presented, followed by a section on force field validation. We conclude with a brief overview on future perspectives for the development of classical force fields.",

	ABSTRACT = {The non-alternant aromatic azulene, an isomer of alternant naphthalene, differs from the latter in peculiar properties. The large polarization of the π-electron system over the seven and five rings gives to azulene electrophile property a pronounced tendency to donate electrons to an acceptor, substituted at azulene 1 position. This paper presents cases in which azulene transfers electrons to a suitable acceptor as methylium ions, positive charged heteroaromatics and examples of neutral molecules that can accept electrons. The proposed product synthesis was outlined and the expected electron transfer was highlighted by analyzing the NMR, UV-Vis spectra and the pKR+ values.},

We calculated the change of the triple-alpha reaction rate in a microscopic 12-nucleon model of the 12C nucleus and looked for the effects of minimal variations of the strengths of the underlying interactions. Stellar model calculations were performed with the alternative reaction rates. Here, we show that outside a narrow window of 0.5 and 4\% of the values of the strong and Coulomb forces, respectively, the stellar production of carbon or oxygen is reduced by factors of 30 to 1000.}

	abstract = {Objective
	The aim was to evaluate the antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of natural (n-CNSL) and technical (t-CNSL) cashew nut shell liquid against streptococci and enterococci related to dental caries and chronic apical periodontitis, respectively.
	Material and methods
	Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined to assess the antimicrobial effect of both CNSLs (n-CSNL and t-CNSL) against S. oralis ATCC 10557, S. sobrinus ATCC 6715, S. parasanguinis ATCC 903, S. mutans UA 159 and E. faecalis ATCC 19433. The antibiofilm activity was evaluated by total biomass quantification, colony forming unit (CFU) counting and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, cytotoxic effect of the substances was evaluated on L929 and HaCat cell lines by MTS assay.
	Results
	The n-CNSL and t-CNSL showed inhibitory and bactericidal effect against all strains tested in this study, with MIC and MBC values ranging from 1.5 to 25 μg/mL. Overall, both CNSLs showed significant reduction in biomass quantification and enumeration of biofilm-entrapped cells for the strains analyzed, in biofilm formation and preformed biofilms (p < 0.05). In biofilm inhibition assay, the t-CNSL and n-CNSL showed reduction in biomass and CFU number for all bacteria, except in cell viability of S. parasanguinis treated with t-CNSL (p > 0.05). Indeed, SEM images showed a reduction in the amount of biomass, bacterial cells and changes in cellular morphology of S. mutans.
	Conclusion
	In conclusion, both substances showed effective antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against the strains used in the study, except in viability of S. parasanguinis cells treated with t-CNSL.}
